# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: /Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
#      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/imalchemy

  # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
  # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
  # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
  # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
  # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
  # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.

  #       db:
  #         condition: service_healthy
